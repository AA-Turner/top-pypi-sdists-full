"""Read/write helpers for pending deploy operations in METADATA_FILE.

When a deployment starts (sync or ``--no-wait``), the long-running operation
claim and metadata are persisted as a ``pending_operation`` field inside
``METADATA_FILE`` with an owner token and state lifecycle.

Cross-process concurrency on the same machine/filesystem is protected by an
advisory file lock (``deployment_metadata.json.lock``) around read/claim/write
transitions, ensuring atomic ownership and preventing concurrent CLI mutations
from corrupting or overwriting deployment state.

Note on distributed environments: cross-machine / CI runners that do not share
a local filesystem are explicitly out of reach for local-file state. In such
environments, concurrency control relies on remote Agent Engine revalidation
and target-side API conflict rejection.
