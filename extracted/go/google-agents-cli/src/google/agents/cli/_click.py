    """Click group that defers importing subcommand modules until needed.

    Register subcommands with `add_lazy_command(name, "module.path:obj",
    short_help)`. The module is imported only when the command is actually
    invoked (e.g. `tool name ...`) or when its own help is requested
    (`tool name --help`). The parent group's --help (`tool --help`) renders
    the supplied `short_help` strings directly without triggering any imports.

    `short_help` must match the real command's docstring summary; the parity
    test in tests/unittests/cli/test_click.py enforces this.

    Pattern reference:
    https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/complex/#lazily-loading-subcommands

    TODO: Python 3.15 introduces a native `lazy` import keyword (PEP 810). Once
    our minimum Python version reaches 3.15, the `add_lazy_command` mechanism
    here may become redundant — revisit and consider simplifying.
