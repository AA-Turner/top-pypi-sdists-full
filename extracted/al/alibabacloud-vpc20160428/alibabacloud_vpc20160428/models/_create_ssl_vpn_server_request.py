The encryption algorithm you specify for the SSL server does not take effect.
        # 
        # - If the client uses an OpenVPN version earlier than 2.4.0, the SSL server and the client use the encryption algorithm you specify for the SSL server. The SSL server supports the following encryption algorithms:
        # 
        #   - **AES-128-CBC** (default): AES-128-CBC
        # 
        #   - **AES-192-CBC**: AES-192-CBC
        #

        # The client CIDR block.
        # 
        # This is the CIDR block from which IP addresses are allocated to the virtual network interface controller (NIC) of the client. It is not the existing internal network CIDR block of the client.
        # 
        # When a client accesses the local network through an SSL-VPN connection, the VPN gateway allocates an IP address from the specified client CIDR block to the client. The client uses the allocated IP address to access cloud resources.
        # 
        # When you specify the client CIDR block, make sure that the number of IP addresses included in the client CIDR block is at least four times the number of SSL connections of the current VPN gateway.

        # <summary>Click to view the reason</summary>
        # 
        # For example, if you specify 192.168.0.0/24 as the client CIDR block, the system first divides a subnet with a subnet mask of 30 from the 192.168.0.0/24 CIDR block, such as 192.168.0.4/30, and then allocates an IP address from 192.168.0.4/30 for the client to use. The remaining three IP addresses are occupied by the system to ensure network communication. In this case, one client consumes four IP addresses. Therefore, to ensure that all your clients can be allocated IP addresses, make sure that the number of IP addresses included in the specified client CIDR block is at least four times the number of SSL connections of the VPN gateway.

        # > - The subnet mask of the client CIDR block must be 16 to 29 bits in length.
        # > - Make sure that the client CIDR block does not overlap with the local CIDR block, the VPC CIDR block, or any routing CIDR block associated with the client terminal.

If you need to specify a public CIDR block as the client CIDR block, you must change the Settings to make the public CIDR block the user CIDR block of the virtual private cloud (VPC) to ensure that the VPC can access the public CIDR block. For more information about user CIDR blocks, see [virtual private cloud (VPC) FAQ](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/185311.html).
        # > - After you create an SSL server, the system automatically adds routing for the client CIDR block in the route table of the VPC instance. Do not manually add routing for the client CIDR block in the route table of the VPC instance. Otherwise, SSL-VPN connection traffic transmission exceptions may occur.
