# This code was added to Impyla in 2016 as a compatibility layer to allow use of either python-sasl or pure-sasl 
# via PR https://github.com/cloudera/impyla/pull/179
# Even though thrift_sasl lists pure-sasl as dependency here https://github.com/cloudera/thrift_sasl/blob/master/setup.py#L34 
# but it still calls functions native to python-sasl in this file https://github.com/cloudera/thrift_sasl/blob/master/thrift_sasl/__init__.py#L82
# Hence this code is required for the fallback to work.

        thrift_sasl expects encode() to return data with a 4-byte big-endian
        length header prepended (per RFC 4422 SASL framing). python-sasl's
        encode() includes this header via Cyrus SASL, but pure-sasl's wrap()
        returns only the wrapped payload, so we must add the header here.
        
        Note: Prior to this fix, encode() incorrectly called unwrap() instead
        of wrap(), and decode() called wrap() instead of unwrap(). This bug
        existed since Feb 2016 (cloudera/impyla PR #179) but only manifests
        when using pure-sasl with GSSAPI and auth-int/auth-conf QOP modes.
