Sim runtime — binds the shared native cores to a MuJoCo model.

Phase B left us with native ``Servo`` and ``DriveBase`` types whose
math is byte-identical to the firmware. This module is the *I/O*
layer that turns that into a working sim:

  * Reading the wheel angle from a MuJoCo ``jointpos`` sensor and
    converting to encoder counts the native ``Servo`` consumes.
  * Mapping the native servo's [-100, 100] power output onto the
    MuJoCo actuator's torque ``ctrl`` range.
  * Driving everything from a single ``SimRuntime.step()`` call so the
    user's main loop is just ``while not done: rt.step()``.

Design notes
------------

The firmware has a ``MotorProcess`` C-callback registry that the
``machine.Timer`` ISR fires at 1 kHz. The sim doesn't need that
infrastructure: there's no ISR, the "tick" is just the next
``mj_step``. ``SimRuntime`` keeps its own list of registered ticks
(every adapter registers itself at construction) and fires them in
order each step. The runtime's ``now_ms`` clock advances by
``timestep`` every step, mirroring the firmware's
``virtual_now_ms``.

User-facing classes here implement enough of the firmware driver
shape (``run_speed``, ``brake``, ``coast``, ``angle``,
``run_target``, plus DriveBase ``straight``/``turn``/``stop``/
``is_done``) for the existing tests + the planned ``openbricks-sim
run`` command (Phase C2) to drive them. Other interfaces (IMU,
ColorSensor) land in later phases when their MuJoCo sensor binding is
wired up.

      1. Read the joint-position sensor (radians).
      2. Convert to encoder counts via ``counts_per_rev``.

         [-100, 100].
      4. Convert power to torque through a DC-MOTOR MODEL and write
         the ``ctrl`` value.

    The DC model is the fidelity linchpin (issue #234): the shared
    servo core's feed-forward assumes ``power == voltage duty`` on a
    motor whose speed self-limits through back-EMF at
    ``OB_SERVO_DEFAULT_RATED_DPS`` (power 100 -> 300 dps free run).
    Mapping power LINEARLY to torque (the old behaviour) applied
    cruise-level feed-forward as a huge PERMANENT torque — ~4x the
    wheel-ground traction limit — so the wheels broke loose, the
    reaction torque wheelied the chassis, and the control loop
    limit-cycled through the slip nonlinearity. The model here is
    the classic linear DC motor::

        torque = T_STALL * (power/100 - wheel_dps / RATED_DPS)

    which puts the torque equilibrium exactly where the core's
    feed-forward expects it, and bounds torque at ``T_STALL`` —
    chosen just BELOW the traction limit (mu*Fn*r ~ 0.066 Nm on the
    default chassis) so no command can break traction, while still
    leaving >2x the acceleration headroom the 1500 deg/s^2 default
    trajectory needs (>10x at the older 360 default).

    User-facing methods (``run_speed`` / ``run_target`` / ``brake`` /

        an RGB texture, the printed colour at any (x, y) on the mat
        is what the real sensor would see.
      * **Untextured material** — the material's ``rgba`` (a single
        flat colour).
      * **No material** — the geom's own ``rgba``.

    Texture sampling is CPU-side: read ``model.tex_data`` directly,
    compute UV from the geom-local hit coordinate, index the texel.
    No GL context, no offscreen rendering — works on macOS / Linux /
    Windows identically. The trade-off is that we don't simulate
    lighting, shadows, or geom layering: a flat printed mat is
    rendered byte-accurately, but a translucent overlay above it
    would not be composited.
