"""Per-round randomization of WRO mission elements.

The WRO RoboMission rules call for some game elements to be re-placed
each round before the team's robot starts. Randomization is the part
of the challenge that forces robots to *perceive* the field rather
than rely on hardcoded positions. Per the WRO General Rules glossary
(``Robot Round`` definition): "Before the round starts with the first
team but after all robots are placed on the robot parking,
randomizations to game fields (if any) are done."

This module is the openbricks-sim equivalent. After ``load_world``
parses the MJCF and instantiates ``MjData``, the caller asks
``randomize(model, data, world="wro-2026-elementary", seed=N)`` to
permute the randomizable game elements. The change is applied
directly to ``data.qpos`` (every randomizable element rides on a
freejoint), and ``mj_forward`` refreshes derived quantities. The
return value is the chosen layout — body name → slot label — for
logging and test pins.

Randomization specs are per-world and pulled from each category's
Game Rules PDF. A world maps to a *tuple of specs*: most worlds
have one spec (one shuffle group), but Senior has four — one per
cement-element colour group, since the rules permute within each
colour's storage area independently. ``randomize()`` runs each
spec in sequence with a single seeded RNG so determinism is
preserved across the multi-group case.
