"""Regression test for the v0.10.0 publish failure.

The failure mode: ``python -m build`` runs ``setup.py`` inside an
isolated environment where the repo root's
``native/user_c_modules/openbricks/`` directory isn't reachable
(only the sdist's contents are). If the shared C cores aren't
bundled in the sdist via ``MANIFEST.in``, ``_sync_cores()`` raises
``"missing shared core source"`` and the wheel build aborts.

This test builds a fresh sdist with ``python setup.py sdist`` and
inspects the resulting tarball — every shared core (``*_core.c`` /
``*_core.h``) must be present in ``native/_shared/`` inside the
tarball, or the publish workflow will break the next time a tag is
pushed.

Skipped if ``setuptools`` can't run (extremely unlikely on a normal
sim install).
