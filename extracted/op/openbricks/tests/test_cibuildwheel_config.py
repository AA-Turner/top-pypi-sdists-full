"""Regression test for the cibuildwheel config that drives PyPI wheel
publishing.

The failure mode this guards against: someone deletes or trims the
``[tool.cibuildwheel]`` section in ``pyproject.toml`` thinking it's
unused (it isn't — the CI publish job reads it implicitly via
``pypa/cibuildwheel``, with no other config file). Without the
config, cibuildwheel falls back to its defaults: PyPy gets built
(slow, no users), aarch64 + i686 attempt cross-compile, and the
post-build smoke import is skipped — a broken wheel can land on
PyPI before anyone notices.

We assert the contract this repo's publish workflow depends on:
  * The CPython 3.9-3.13 build line.
  * Skips for PyPy / musllinux / 32-bit.
  * The smoke ``test-command`` imports a real attribute of
    ``openbricks_sim._native``.
  * Linux uses ``manylinux_2_28`` (PyPI-accepted; the 0.10.2
    failure was specifically about wheels not being manylinux-tagged).
  * macOS builds universal2.

Skipped if neither ``tomllib`` (3.11+) nor ``tomli`` (the 3.9-3.10
backport) is importable.
