"""
The same robot.py for firmware AND sim — chassis dims declared
once, in the ``DriveBase(...)`` call.

Run this script via the sim::

    openbricks-sim run examples/unified_chassis_dims.py --world empty

…and the same file flashed to ESP32 hardware will drive the same
distance. No second config file. No CLI flag for chassis size.
The ``wheel_diameter_mm`` / ``axle_track_mm`` you pass to
``DriveBase`` are the single source of truth — on firmware they
go straight to the encoder math, and on sim the shim layer picks
them up at construction time and resizes the MuJoCo chassis to
match.

Try changing ``WHEEL_DIAMETER_MM`` to 80 (or ``AXLE_TRACK_MM`` to
200) and re-running — the sim's wheels grow, and ``straight()``
still travels the right number of mm because the wheel
circumference and the encoder readout track each other.

Why this matters
----------------

Without dim sync, ``DriveBase(wheel_diameter_mm=80, ...)`` would
tell the firmware-side odometry math "80 mm wheels" while the sim
physics quietly used 60 mm wheels. The user calls
``db.straight(distance_mm=200)`` and the chassis travels 150 mm
in physics but the user's ``db.distance()`` reports 200 mm.
Silent divergence between firmware's mental model and the sim's
ground truth. This script exists to demonstrate the dim-sync that
prevents it.
