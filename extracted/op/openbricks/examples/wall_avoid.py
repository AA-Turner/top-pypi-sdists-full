Drive forward; stop on a wall — using the firmware HCSR04 driver.

Run with::

    openbricks-sim run examples/wall_avoid.py \\
        --world wro-2026-elementary --viewer

The driver shim replaces ``openbricks.drivers.hcsr04.HCSR04`` with a
sim-aware class that raycasts forward from the chassis ``chassis_dist``
site. From the script's POV the same firmware ``distance_mm()`` is
in use.

Polls the sensor every 50 ms (sim time, via ``time.sleep_ms`` which
the shim patches to step the runtime). Stops when distance drops
below 200 mm — typical "robot is about to hit a wall" threshold.
