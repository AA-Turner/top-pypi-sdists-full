"""One upload per hub per machine.

``openbricks run`` and ``openbricks upload`` both push a program to
the hub through the same raw-paste channel, and the operating system
shares a single BLE link between every process that connects to the
same peripheral (CoreBluetooth, BlueZ and WinRT all multiplex). Two
transfers started from two terminals therefore interleave their bytes
on the hub's REPL — a corrupted program, or both terminals reading
each other's output — and the hub, which sees ONE connection, cannot
tell them apart. The guard lives where the knowledge is: the host
holds a per-hub lock for the duration of a transfer, and a second
transfer to the same hub fails at once, before any scan, with
``an upload is ongoing``.

The lock is an OS-level advisory lock on a file in the temp directory
(``flock`` on POSIX, ``msvcrt.locking`` on Windows), so a CLI that
crashed or was killed mid-transfer never leaves a stale lock behind —
the kernel releases it with the process. The file itself persists and
carries the holder's PID for a curious human; the lock, not the
content, is the guard.
