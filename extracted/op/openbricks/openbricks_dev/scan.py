"""
``openbricks list`` — scan for BLE devices in range and print them.

Uses ``bleak`` so it works on macOS, Linux (BlueZ), and Windows without
platform-specific tooling. Output is sorted by RSSI so the closest /
strongest hub sits at the top — the one you're most likely trying to
flash code to.

We don't filter by service UUID yet: a hub that hasn't had its name
written (or is still in the pre-``apply_persisted_state`` boot window)
won't advertise with any openbricks-specific marker. Showing every
named device in range and letting the human pick is more forgiving than
a tight filter that silently hides the hub you just plugged in. Once
the BLE REPL lands (PR 3), ``list`` can grow a ``--openbricks-only``
flag that filters by the NUS service UUID.
