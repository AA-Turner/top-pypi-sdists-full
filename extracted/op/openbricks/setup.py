``setup.py`` for the ``openbricks_sim._native`` CPython extension.

Needed because we share algorithmic C sources with the firmware (they
live at ``native/user_c_modules/openbricks/*_core.c``, two levels up),
and setuptools refuses both absolute paths *and* relative paths that
reach upward out of the package root. The fix is a tiny pre-build
hook that copies the shared cores into a local ``native/_shared/``
directory so setuptools only ever sees in-tree sources.

Everything else (metadata, dependencies, scripts) still lives in
``pyproject.toml``; setuptools merges the two.

Build contexts
--------------

In a **repo checkout** (editable install, local ``python -m build``,
CI), the firmware sources at ``../../native/user_c_modules/openbricks``
exist and we copy them into ``native/_shared/`` fresh on every build.
That keeps the truth in one place: the firmware's user_c_modules.

In an **sdist build** (PyPI publish, isolated build environment), the
upstream firmware sources are NOT in the source tree — only what
made it into the sdist tarball is. ``MANIFEST.in`` ensures the
already-synced ``native/_shared/*.{c,h}`` files are bundled, so the
``_sync_cores()`` step is a no-op (the files already exist locally
and there's nothing upstream to copy from). The fallback path here
detects that case and proceeds without raising.
