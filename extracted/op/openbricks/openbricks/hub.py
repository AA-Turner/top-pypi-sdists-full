Hub — board-level peripherals (status LED, user button) for each
supported MCU devkit.

Concrete hubs:

* ``ESP32DevkitHub``    — ESP32 DevKitC-V4: blue LED on GPIO 2.
* ``ESP32S3DevkitHub``  — ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1: onboard WS2812 RGB LED on
  GPIO 48.

Both hubs expect **two** momentary pushbuttons, each wired between a
GPIO and GND:

* ``bluetooth_button_pin`` (classic ESP32 default **GPIO 5**;
  ESP32-S3 default **GPIO 38** — the S3 has only ten analog-capable
  pins, ADC1 = GPIO 1-10, and a button doesn't need one) —
  short-press toggles BLE on/off. Watched by
  :class:`openbricks.bluetooth_button.BluetoothToggleButton` which
  the hub auto-wires when ``bluetooth=True`` (the default).
* The **program button** (default **GPIO 39**) — short-press starts
  or stops ``/program.py``. Watched by
  :mod:`openbricks.launcher` directly, which the frozen default
  ``main.py`` starts via ``launcher.run()``.

Two pins → no duration-based dispatch. Each button does one thing on
every short press.

We deliberately avoid GPIO 0 (BOOT) for either role: holding it
during reset puts the ESP32 into the ROM bootloader, so sharing that
pin with an application button would turn an accidental power-glitch
into a flash-mode drop.

Both hubs auto-wire the BLE toggle button by default (``bluetooth=True``):
**constructing a hub** restores the persisted BLE state, installs a
short-press handler on the ``bluetooth_button_pin``, and — on the S3 —
paints the WS2812 blue (BLE on) or yellow (BLE off). While a user
program runs, the same LED **flashes** its state colour at 1 Hz as a
"robot is running" indicator (plain on/off blink on the classic
ESP32's single-colour LED), returning to the solid idle colour when
the program stops. Put
``hub = ESP32S3DevkitHub()`` in your ``main.py`` to turn that on;
omit the call (or pass ``bluetooth=False``) to keep the button free
for your own use.

External I2C components like SSD1306 OLEDs are **not** part of the hub
— they're wired to any I2C bus the user chooses, instantiated directly
from ``openbricks.drivers.ssd1306`` or similar, and used alongside the
hub rather than through it.

    Builds a short-press watcher on the hub's button (recolouring the

    on ``hub.bluetooth_toggle`` so callers can ``stop()`` it later
    if they want the button for something else.

    Until 1.0.10 this also called ``bluetooth.apply_persisted_state()``
    to restore the persisted BLE-on/off state. That was wrong: the
    frozen ``main.py`` calls ``apply_persisted_state()`` *first*,
    bringing BLE up + advertising. A second call from here re-runs
    ``ble.active(True)`` — which under MicroPython's NimBLE port
    unconditionally tears down and re-inits the stack
    (``mp_bluetooth_init`` calls ``mp_bluetooth_deinit`` even when
    already active, stopping advertising and clearing registered
    services). The follow-up ``ble_repl.start()`` then early-returns
    because ``_state["bridge"]`` is still set from the first call,
    so services + advertising are never re-installed. End result:
    BLE active but invisible to scanners.

    main.py owns BLE lifecycle. The hub's role is the toggle button.
