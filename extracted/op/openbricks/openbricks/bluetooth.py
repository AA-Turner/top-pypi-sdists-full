"""
Persistent Bluetooth on/off state for the hub.

The firmware ships with BLE compiled in (so ``mpremote``-over-BLE
code transfer works). At runtime we let the user toggle the advertising
stack on and off; the choice is persisted in NVS so reboots don't lose
the state. Default (no key in NVS yet) is **on**.

Typical usage from ``main.py`` right after the firmware boots:

    from openbricks import bluetooth
    bluetooth.apply_persisted_state()

Then toggle programmatically (or from the hub's button — see
``openbricks.hub.ESP32DevkitHub`` once that integration lands):

    bluetooth.toggle()                # flip current state, persist, apply
    bluetooth.set_enabled(False)      # explicit off

Activating BLE requires a hub name (``openbricks.HUB_NAME``) — flash
the image with ``scripts/flash_firmware.py --name NAME`` first. We
refuse to advertise with no name rather than defaulting to a shared
value, since two hubs with the same advertising name can't be
individually addressed.

``esp32.NVS`` and ``bluetooth.BLE`` are imported lazily so desktop
tests running under unix MicroPython don't need to have the firmware-
only modules present — they install fakes in ``tests/_fakes_ble.py``.
